# S21Core.StyleRules

## Setup Solution level StyleCop

*  Copy S21CoreStyleRules.ruleset, Settings.StyleCop, stylecop.json to the solution dir.
*  Add them to the solution items, by right clicking the 'Solution Items' folder and add existing items.
*  Projects adhering to these rules must have the `StyleCop.Analyzers`, `StyleCop.MSBuild`, `StyleCop.Errors.MSBuild` nuget packages installed.
*  Edit .csproj file to reference solution level ruleset. To do this, add this to the property group `<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>..\S21CoreStyleRules.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>`. *Note* - Sometimes this can be overriden to blank in the csproj, re-add it if it does.
*  If the file is autogenerated add this to the top of the file to ignore it. ` // <auto-generated/> `

## General Conventions

* Private variables to be prefixed with _ underscore.
* Properties to be declared below private variables. 
* Comments to be used in code where necessary and is not self-explanatory. 
* All code ready for commit to be peer reviewed (code reviewed) if needed. This is not an accountability issue but a safeguarding protocol to maintain project consistency and minimise problems in production. All code reviews to be labelled/logged against commit (method pending discussion). 
* Use unit test projects where available to test core business logic and should be run and passing before commiting.
